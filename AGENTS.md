# Engineering Agreement

## Communication and approval
- Before changing implementation code, explain the proposed changes and wait for explicit approval.
- Reading files, inspecting code, and discussing designs do not require approval.
- Ask focused questions when requirements are unclear. Keep communication concise.

## Change documentation
- Keep each independent change (new feature, bug fix, refactoring, or other work) under `changes/<id>-<short-name>/`.
- `proposal.md` gives the user story, why the change is needed, and what we would like to have, in plain language.
- `spec.md` defines the functional and non-functional requirements and acceptance criteria, in plain language. How it is built goes in `plan.md`.
- `plan.md` states what must exist to meet each functional requirement, with no explanations or steps, and records the technical decisions.
- `qa.md` defines how the change is verified and records the results.
- `tasks/` holds one small file per task, numbered in the order to do them. An agent implements one task at a time, using `spec.md` and `plan.md`.
- Use `changes/_templates/` when starting a new change.
- Follow the templates exactly: add no sections or fields, and keep content in the section it belongs to. If something has no place, or the template is wrong, raise it and propose a template change.
- Keep documentation proportional to the size of the change.
- Do not implement a change until its proposal, specification, plan, QA plan, and tasks have been reviewed and approved.

## Implementation
- Follow the approved `proposal.md`, `spec.md` and `plan.md`. If a deviation is needed, stop and ask for approval.
- Work in small, independently verifiable increments.
- Follow existing architecture and code conventions; avoid unrelated changes and unnecessary dependencies.
- Add or update tests for behavioral changes; run relevant tests.
- Do not create branches, commit, or push without permission.

## Completion
- Summarize changed files, tests run and their results, and outstanding risks or questions.
