description: Implement one approved task of a small change (feature, bug fix, refactoring) against its specification, technical plan, and QA plan.

# Implement a Change

## Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the change's `proposal.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `qa.md`, and the given file in `tasks/`. Ask which task to implement if it is not given.
2. Confirm that the proposal, specification, technical plan, QA plan, and tasks are approved and that material questions are resolved. If approval is unclear, ask before coding.
3. Inspect the relevant existing code, identify reusable functionality, and explain the proposed small change. Wait for explicit approval before modifying code.
4. Implement only the given task, following the approved technical approach and the coding principles below.
5. Write or update the relevant automated tests, preferably before implementation when practical. Include normal behavior, error cases, and boundaries identified in `qa.md`.
6. Run the relevant tests and checks. Do not claim that a test passed unless it was actually executed.
7. Report changed files, test results, outstanding issues, and any deviations. Update the status of each item in Test Coverage in `qa.md`.
8. Stop and request approval before changing the approved proposal, specification, architecture, or technical approach. Do not commit without permission.

## Coding Principles

### Readability and simplicity

- Write small, focused methods and functions with one clear responsibility.
- Avoid deep nesting of `if` statements and loops. Prefer guard clauses, early returns, and well-named helper functions where they improve clarity.
- Keep the main execution path easy to follow.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and interfaces.
- Prefer straightforward code over clever shortcuts or unnecessary abstractions.
- Keep parameter lists manageable; introduce a parameter object only when it improves the interface.
- Explain *why* in comments when intent is not apparent; avoid comments that merely restate code.

### Architecture and future changes

- Preserve clear responsibilities and boundaries between components.
- Favor high cohesion and low coupling; avoid leaking implementation details across interfaces.
- Reuse existing code and established patterns rather than duplicating business logic.
- Avoid hardcoded assumptions that would obstruct likely future features.
- Design for reasonable extension without implementing speculative functionality.
- Keep changes localized and preserve existing behavior unless the approved specification requires otherwise.
- Do not optimize only for making the current change work: leave the codebase easy to understand, maintain, and extend for the next change.

### Continuous code quality

- Refactor within the approved scope when needed to keep the implementation clean.
- Do not knowingly introduce avoidable technical debt just to complete the change faster.
- Keep changes small, reviewable, and independently testable.
- Avoid unrelated refactoring and new dependencies unless explicitly approved.
- Prefer clear, testable interfaces and explicit error handling.

### Testing and verification

- Follow the test strategy and test coverage in `qa.md`.
- Prefer testing observable behavior rather than private implementation details.
- Include failure paths and relevant edge cases.
- Run relevant regression tests to protect existing functionality.
- Record what was tested, what passed, what failed, and what could not be run.

## Completion Criteria

A change is complete only when:

- It satisfies the approved `proposal.md`, `spec.md` and `plan.md`.
- Relevant `qa.md` checks have been implemented and executed, or any exceptions are explicitly reported.
- The implementation is readable, maintainable, and does not unnecessarily complicate future features.
- Deviations, risks, and remaining issues have been reported.
